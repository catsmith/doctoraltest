Of the three works, <i>Memorias</i> is the oldest, the shortest, and has the most complicated manuscript signature. That is, there are ten known <i>Memorias</i> manuscripts. Of those, the parchment original archetype (A), which was created between 1401 and 1404, has been lost. Additionally, two later fifteenth century paper copies of A (B and C), a sixteenth century paper copy of A (D), and an eighteenth paper copy of A (H) have also been lost or misplaced. The earliest dated manuscript we do have is a partial copy- 5 of 9 folios of C (E), dated 1733, which exists at the Archivo Histórico de Viana, a palace library in Córoba, Spain. Next comes two copies of D, from the second half of the eighteenth century, the full nine folios in each manuscript are found within different collections and both are located at the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid (F, G). The Catholic Church’s Columbine library in Seville, the Institución Colombina,  (a place that holds many of Christopher Columbus' letters and records), also houses a full manuscript (I) which was copied in 1778 by Manuel de Ayora from manuscript H. Finally, there is a nineteenth century copy (J) from F and G, located in Córdoba at the Biblioteca pública provincial.

<p>For the research here, manuscript "I" was used as the baseline for the digital transcription because it is a copy of a copy of the archetype. This was used in consultation with the partial manuscript "E" as well, as "E" is the earliest dated accessible manuscript and likely a copy of "C".
