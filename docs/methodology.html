<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Keeping the intentional  transparency of  the subjectivity of the digitizing and editorial process in mind, the guidelines developed for the transcription of <i>Memorias</i>, <i>Arboleda de los enfermos</i>, and the <i>Vita Christi</i> rely heavily on the structural guidelines set forth in the Estoria de Espanna Digital Project (heretofore referred to as EdE) and the TEI. The guidelines for this project, however, are distinguished from the above mentioned EdE project in that this edition does not compare varying witnesses of the same manuscript thereby eliminating the need to scrutinize variance. Additionally, it should be recognized that the primary purpose of this research is not paleographical and rather analytical in its purpose. Therefore, while attention has been paid to the appearance of the texts, that is not the primary concern. Like other printed editions, the editor has made decisions regarding the transmission of the manuscripts and early printed books to the digital print format. </p>
<p>Generally, when there is a discrepancy between modern language and medieval, the editor has opted to preserve the latter. For example, the editor tends to retain the original medieval punctuation and capitalization whenever possible. The assumption embedded in the conservative approach being that medieval punctuation (while seemingly without clear normalization then) could follow its own internal reasoning or could serve as a fingerprint to identify idiosyncrasies of the author. It is possible that in the digital edition, some modernization has been processed by the computer (Optical Character Recognition programs have built-in systems to achieve this) and this work attempts to revert the transcription to better reflect the original text. As many who are familiar with Iberian medieval orthography in the vernacular have indicated, capitalization and punctuation do not appear to have been normalized. The editorial decision has been made in this case, that all inconsistencies in orthography and punctuation should be preserved as much as possible to offer the contemporary reader insight into the medieval mind. Additionally, medieval forms of writing (for example, the substitution of "v" for the "u" or the "ç" for the "z") have additionally been preserved. The editor is of the opinion that any reader of the modern language can readily identify patterns in letter usage, for example, and learn to read Medieval Castilian or Catalan in a matter of  paragraphs, or even lines. Discrepancies like, the use of "v" instead of  "u" is  a quite clear substitution. As is the "ç" instead of "z". It therefore, seems unnecessary, and even a detraction, to normalize this orthography.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, and indeed in most instances, the approach to the implementation of the tags in XML has been based on prior convention (whether in reference to other similar digital edition projects, or the TEI/ EdE guidelines) and this is purposeful because the transferability of these documents is of utmost importance in regard to the objectives of this study, provided open access and easy readability to scholars of these medieval texts.</p>
<p>Similar to the EdE transcription guidelines the following conventions were used to transcribe the documents into XML. (EdE Guidelines) Each folio side (recto/ verso) is marked with the &lt;pb/&gt; tag to indicate this very visual break in the writing. Textual divisions within the folios, such chapter divisions or major shifts of content are marked with the &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; tag and numbered consecutively. The &lt;ab&gt;&lt;/ab&gt; tag generally represents the level of a modern day sentence or a natural pause or break in the discourse and in some cases, is also indicated by a "calderón". In the case of the Vita Christi, columns are also tagged as &lt;cb n="a"/&gt; or &lt;cb n="b"/&gt;. Line breaks are tagged as &lt;lb/&gt;, &lt;lb break="no"/&gt; or &lt;lb rend="hyphen" break="no"/&gt; depending on whether or not a word is completed at the end of the line, broken in half to follow on the next line without the use of a written hyphen, or the same but with a hyphen. For footers or catchwords, the tags &lt;fw type="catch"&gt; or &lt;fw type="footer"&gt; with a place indicator (like "br" for "bottom right") are used. Signatures are also indicated as follows: &lt;fw type="sig" place="bm"&gt;signature&lt;/fw&gt;. In regards to word spacing, "Medieval word spacing can be inconsistent…" (4, EdE)  and so the decision to identify a space between two words is left to the judgment of the transcriber. And likewise, as with the EdE, this edition is not a paleographic study and therefore discrepancies in letter formation have not been noted. Glyphs, when they occur at the beginning of a word, such as "Ffernando", are noted thus with a "choice" tag: &lt;choice&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;&lt;am&gt;&lt;g&gt;ff&lt;/g&gt;&lt&lt;/am&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;expan&gt;&lt;ex&gt;f&lt;/ex&gt;&lt;/expan&gt;&lt;/choice&gt;ernando</p>
