<h2>Arboleda de los Enfermos</h2>
<p>
The two works currently attributed to Teresa de Cartagena, <i>Arboleda de los enfermos</i> and the subsequent defense of her writing, <i>Admiración operum Dei</i>, appear in one manuscript, which was copied by Pedro López de Trigo before 1460. It is held in the Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo del Escorial (h.III.24). A copy of the manuscript was requested and a full digital facsimile was sent back. The cover page of the manuscript includes different editorial notes, including the word "carta" as if someone wished to genrefy the manuscript for its place in the library's collection. But the document refers to itself as a "tratado" as Jesus Velasco mentions in his description of the manuscript, dedicated to Juana de Mendoza, wife of Gómez Manrique, poet, dramatist, and soldier (1412-1490), "who held the position of Corregidor  of Salamanca (1454), Ávila (1465) and Toledo (1477)." (Velasco "Teresa")
