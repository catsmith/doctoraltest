<h2>Vita Christi</h2>
<p>
For the <i>Vita Christi</i>, the choice of version was straightforward as well. The Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid was contacted via their request service and sent back, in response, a full digital facsimile of the incunable, published posthumously in 1497. The book's cream colored parchment cover, clearly dotted with hair follicles and bound in white string, reads, "Kempis Vita Christi POR Sor Ysabel DE Villena. Letra Gótica. Libro Rarisi Impreso año 1497."  A stamped seal of the "Biblioteca" on the front cover and a sticker that reads "incunable 1973" complete the picture.  On the stained inside title page, it reads: "Vita Christi de la Reverent Abadesa de la Trinitat" followed below by a seal, a peeling sticker of a second seal and yet another library stamp.  The last introductory page was written by Aldonça de Montsoriu, Isabel's successor. It was she who edited and published Isabel's work and included a note of introduction to the <i>Vita Christi</i>, which she signs, "Humil sirvienta y oradora Aldonça de Montsoriu, indigna abadesa del monestir de la Sancta Trinitat." The <i>Vita</i> then begins in two running columns, complete with numbered chapter headings and concludes on page 306 (verso) with a "Deo Gracias" and an image of a Christogram, followed by a "Tavla", which is a list of all the chapter headings. This document served as the base text for the digital transcription and analysis in the dissertation. It was used in conjunction with footnotes and criticism from additional editions of the VC included in the bibliography.
