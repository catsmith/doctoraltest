<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Fifteenth century Iberian women wrote about themselves and their environments and offered their stories as <i>exempla</i> to women of the future. They wrote to reaffirm their own authority, establish a recorded and common
        memory, and teach the coming generations. In order to achieve these aims, Iberian medieval writing women replaced the omnipresence of the male patriarchy with the only other acceptable framework of authority—that
        of the omnipotence of God (and by extension, all figures related to Him). They chose God's moral and spiritual structure over the male institutions purportedly representing Him. It was an essential strategy and
        one that allowed the women their desperate act of counter-strike: an attempt to push back the coming tide in the sixteenth century of further restrictions on their work and lives. Therefore, as a contribution to
        recent efforts to voice this corpus of women's writing -their concerns and their message- this digital edition permits the user a view into the rhetorical and pedagogical strategies in Leonor López de Córdoba's
        <i>Memorias</i> (c. 1412), <i>Arboleda de los enfermos</i> (c.1450-1460) by Teresa de Cartagena, and the <i>Vita Christi</i> (published posthumously in 1497) by Isabel de Villena. Based on the integration of a digital taxonomy of
        semantic tags that permit a systematic, yet subjective interpretation of the texts, users of this edition may observe first had the significant evidence of shared pedagogical and persuasive strategies in the three
        works.</p>
