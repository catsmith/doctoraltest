<h2>Isabel de Villena</h2>
<p>
According to Hauf i Valls in his introduction to selections from the Vita Christi, Isabel de Villena was born in 1430 as Elionor Manuel de Villena, daughter to the great Enric d'Aragó i de Castella, the Marqués de Villena. Educated at the royal court of Castile, Isabel entered the Franciscan Valencian Trinità convent of the Poor Clares, and became its abbess around 1462.

That Isabel was born of noble blood traceable back to the King of Castile, is not a disputed fact. According to Hauf i Valls, Isabel's father was in fact a "personatge noveslesc" due to his natural intelligence and insatiable curiosity. Enric de Villena appears to have passed on his responsibilities of governance and business, opting instead to focus his exaggerated acumen on his studies, earning himself the reputation of living "en els núvols, sense tocar amb els peus en la terra" (7). By all accounts, Enric was a bon vivant who neglected his marital responsibilities in favor of diversifying his relationships (Isabel's birth out of wedlock, a result of one of his dalliances). The Marqués was named Maestre of Calatrava, a position apparently "incompatible with marriage" (also as a curious coincidence, the same position that Leonor's father Martín López de Córdoba occupied thirty years before) and Enric's wife by law, Isabel's stepmother, was deemed barren and relegated to a convent, the marriage annulled (8). Isabel lost her father too at an early age and, following his death was sent to live at the court of Valencia with her aunt Queen Maria Catella, wife of Alfonso the Magnanimous (Cantavella VII). Queen María was also the daughter of Enrique III of Castile and the very same Catalina of Lancaster to whom Leonor and Teresa were both linked.

In Rosanna Cantavella and Lluïsa Parra's introduction to their critical edition, they ponder the question of Villena's choice to enter the convent in the first place, saying: "però podem suposar que hi influierien el naixement il.legítim I el fet que la seua fortuna no fos gran, factors que la farien difícil d'esposar. També es podia especular que la jove Elionor ja tingués el gust per les lletres..." (IX)  The latter reasoning makes the most sense, if one assesses Isabel's inclinations in writing her book.

The genre of the Vitae Christi was not new when Villena crafted her own. Villena's <i>Vita Christi</i>, as it is known, comes out of a tradition of medieval texts (primarily Franciscan) that relate Christ's life: "S'emmarca dins una tradició d'obres medievals que, prenent com a base la narració de la vida de Jesucrist, abunden en comentaris per induir a la meditació espiritual, amb l'objectiu de commoure l'anima cristiana" (Cantavella IX-X). A monk of the same order, the aforementioned Francesc Eiximenis (c. 1340-1409), powerful in the Court and a contemporary of Saint Vincent Ferrer, had already written a Vita Christi in Catalan before Villena wrote hers and his was already in circulation during Isabel's lifetime (Terry 31). It is also likely that, in addition to this work, Isabel would have been familiar with Eiximenis' other work, the  <i>Llibres de les dones</i>, the didactic treatise for women (Archer 16). Hauf i Valls additionally found evidence of influence of La Cartoixà Landulf of Saxony's <i>Vita</i> in Isabel's book and so it follows that she was, at the very least, well read in her area of authorship.
