<h2>Teresa de Cartagena</h2>
<p>
The second protagonist of this project, a woman who was perhaps the first to speak specifically to the intellectual rights of women on the Peninsula, was a nun named Teresa de Cartagena (Howe, "Teresa de Cartagena and Entendimiento" 140).

The historian, María Rivera Garretas states Teresa as one of 5 children (the other siblings being Alfonso, Alvaro, Juana, and María) from the marriage of Pedro de Cartagena (1387-1478) and María de Saravia.  While there has been some questioning regarding the particulars of her early biography, Rivera Garretas, Louis Hutton (an editor of Teresa's works), and Gale Seidenspinner- Nuñez (a translator of her works into English) all agree that "La fecha de nacimiento de Teresa de Cartagena la situó este autor entre 1420 y 1435." (Rivera Garretas, "Teresa de Cartagena" 756)

By the time of her birth to the Cartagena family, who were Jewish converts, yet politically connected and powerful, Teresa de Cartagena's father, Pedro de Cartagena, already enjoyed ecclesiastical favor and had been named Bishop of Burgos (Howe). His father, the former Bishop of Burgos, Pablo de Santa María, was said to have been converted by Saint Vincent Ferrer himself, the famous preacher of the Black Friars. Also according to Teresa Howe, "During the co-regency of Catalina of Lancaster and Fernando de Antequera… the Cartagenas sided with the latter rather than with the Queen in the struggle for power within Castile…" ("Autobiographical Writing", Howe 43). This connection, albeit an antagonistic one, to Catalina of Lancaster, links Teresa to Leonor López de Córdoba through their political relationships. Due to her family name, therefore, Teresa was slated to become a powerful and successful member of the elite (like Leonor), with familial ties to Juan II, Enrique IV, and the Catholic Kings.

However, Teresa's lineage could not save her from tragedy and by the age of twenty-four Teresa lost her hearing and her deafness prevented her from fully participating in medieval society or assuming the roles initially planned for her. According to Howe and others, Teresa's deafness compounded the isolation imposed on most women of her class: "The interiority of most women's lives within the confines of the home or the cloister is magnified in the case of Teresa because of her gender and her disability" (44). Cartagena wrote her first work on deafness, Arboleda de los enfermos (c. second half of the fifteenth century) and then her second, Admiración operum Dey, which was a defense of Arboleda to "...the new Bishop of Burgos...who rejected a woman's access to writing and disputed her authorship of Arboleda by accusing her of plagiarizing male sources." (Seidenspinner-Núñez and Kim, 140). Based on her own account, at the moment of writing Arboleda Teresa had been deaf for a period of 20 years, a process that caused her to suffer a long period of sadness and isolation, which she describes in her treatise. By 1480, Cartagena had taken up the habit initially as a "poor Clare" in a Franciscan convent and then moved to the Cistercian order of Las Huelgas in Burgos. Some speculate that this move was motivated in part due to the Franciscans position with regard to Jewish converts following the pogroms in the summer of 1391.

On 16 June 1391 Enrique (or his regents) wrote from Segovia to the council and justices of Burgos stating that the events in certain cities, such as Seville and Córdoba, which had resulted from the "inducements and persuasions" of Ferrant Martínez, when "some of the lower class [gentes menudas] of those towns, acting like country people [rústicos] of little understanding" and who feared neither God nor the king's justice, and without consideration for the young age of the King and conditions of the time, attacked the Jews and killed some of them, robbed others and forced some to be converted to Christianity (Roth 132-133).
</p>
<p>
Unlike the biographic information we retain of Leonor, Teresa's "suffered a literal expunging of most of its details" ("Autobiographical Writing", Howe 42). which Howe speculates may be in part due to her Jewishness and the growing antisemitic sentiments during her lifetime as well. 
</p>
<p>
While Teresa's family had publicly converted in 1390 (before the pogroms), it is still possible that her situation was at least conditioned by the knowledge that her family represented an easily identifiable threat to the lower classes.
