<h2>Leonor López de Córdoba</h2>
<p>
The writer credited with having composed the first autobiography in Castilian Spanish, a tale of a life in first person, is Leonor López de Córdoba. As the memoir itself tells us, López de Córdoba's objective in writing her life history was to document her own personal suffering and ultimate survival in the face of difficulty, to establish the true record of her family's suffering and redemption, and to comfort others who may find themselves in a similar position. And in chronicling her life as she did, Leonor effectively invented a new literary genre in which her voice, her memory, and her life experiences served as a real-world example for her readership. Leonor López de Córdoba is probably the most widely studied of all three women discussed in this dissertation. Her <i>Memorias</i> has been analyzed for both its literary and historical contribution and because of the nature of the text, we know quite a lot about Leonor López de Córdoba, in contrast to other women writers of the time.

However, Leonor López de Córdoba's whole story begins not with her birth as in her memoir, but with the death of Alfonso XI, King of Castile (d. 1350) at the hands of the Plague. A personality from the chronicles of kings, the monumental experiences in López de Córdoba's life are framed either by larger political crises or the Plague. Her life was intimately intertwined with the greater ills of medieval society in a way difficult to conceive of today.

King of Castile, Alfonso XI, fathered one legitimate heir, Pedro I, with Queen María of Portugal as well as many sons with his mistress, Leonor de Guzmán. Upon his father's death, Pedro claimed the throne and Queen Maria ordered the execution of Leonor de Guzmán (Ruiz 78). King Pedro I, in the following years of his reign, then systematically assassinated three of his half-brothers, luring them to their death under the guise of reconciliation (Ruiz 79). Pedro the Cruel, as he was later referred to by his enemies, may have legitimately claimed the throne, but his lack of popularity among the nobles and across the border in Aragon, led to his eventual demise. Violence was revisited on him and his supporters, which included Leonor López de Cordoba's family, when one remaining half-brother, Count Enrique II of Trastámara successfully led a campaign against Pedro I, and ascended to the throne in 1369, establishing the "bastard" line of the Trastámaras securely on the Castilian throne (Ruiz 80).

Most of what we know about Leonor López de Córdoba's personal history, we have learned directly from her memoir, <i>Memorias</i>. However, there are mentions of her elsewhere in the chronicles of Castile and Juan II as well. There is also a document of a letter from López de Córdoba indicating that she was born in the fourteenth century around December or January of 1362 in the city of Calatayud at the home of Pedro I. She and her family enjoyed wealth and royal connections. Leonor spent her childhood at the court along with the daughters of the king (<i>las infantas</i>), and her mother, Sancha Carillo, who was Pedro's kinswoman and Alfonso XI's niece. Her father, Martín López de Córdoba, "descendent of the house of Aguilar, and cousin to Don Juan Manuel," was a powerful man in his own right as <i>Maestre</i> of the Order of Calatrava and Alcántara (López de Córdoba, f.196r). The Order of Santiago's purpose evolved from the even older Order of the Knights Templar (abolished in 1312), and whose resources went to the orders of Santiago and Calatrava and the Hospitallers, was to serve as the military might of the Church. By the fifteenth century, this religious order, that originally swore oaths of poverty, chastity, obedience and moral perfection (<i>summa perfectio</i>), had transformed into one of the most politically and physically powerful in Europe. (Huizinga 114). As the Maestre, Martín López de Córdoba served King Pedro I with undying loyalty. Paradoxically, it was this loyalty that condemned the López de Córdoba family and their social circle to a horrible fate.

After Sancha Carillo's untimely death (a fact that Leonor López de Córdoba laments in the <i>Memorias</i>), Leonor's father married her to Ruy Gutierrez de Hinestrosa, another royal member of the court. Leonor was seven years old at the time. Gutierrez de Henestrosa's father, Juan Fernández de Henestrosa, was the <i>Camarero mayor</i> and <i>Chanciller mayor de sello de la puridad</i> to the King Don Pedro and his mother pertained to another important family, as Doña María de Haro, Señora de Haro y los Cameros. López de Córdoba, with her new husband's family, her brother, whom she mentions by name, Don Lope López de Córdoba, her sisters and their husbands, and the daughters of King Pedro I, all moved south to Carmona (a walled city in southern Spain) (López de Córdoba f. 196v). It was not uncommon for young motherless girls to be entrusted to their mother in laws, to be raised and educated until they were deemed old enough to care for their husband's household themselves.

Immediately following these events, Pedro I was killed by Enrique II. Leonor's father initially rushed to the aid of the former King, only to discover that had arrived too late. He then traveled to Carmona with the intention of reuniting with his family and protecting the <i>Infantas</i>.  Knowing that his brother's remaining supporters had fled to Carmona, Enrique of Trastámara laid siege to the city in an effort to eradicate the subversive presence and sublimate his own right to the throne. Based on the <i>Memorias</i>, López de Córdoba recounts that after several months and many attempts to capture the city, in frustration, the King sent a representative to negotiate with the Martín López de Córdoba, and they arrived at an agreement. The <i>Maestre</i> would surrender in exchange for clemency for himself, his family and King Pedro I's daughters. The year was 1371 when Martín López de Córdoba abandoned his fort to surrender to the new King. But he was tragically betrayed, captured, and beheaded in the plaza of San Francisco of Seville. Leonor López de Cordoba was eight or nine years old at the time of her father's execution and she would spend the next nine years of her life imprisoned in the Atarazanas jail of the same city until King Enrique's will, upon his death, released her.

Subsequent to initial studies of Leonor as an author, in the last decade there has been an effort on the part of academics, such as Óscar Perea Rodríguez, to paint a more complete picture of Leonor as an important historical figure, advisor and confidant to Queen Catalina of Lancaster. His book chapter "<i>Por mi Señora, la Reina Catalina. Las donaciones de Leonor López de Córdoba al monasterio cordobés de San Pablo</i> (1409)" contextualizes Leonor's writing by discussing the other documents in which she appears, including two letters from Queen Catalina. Both pieces of correspondence refer to the end of the queen and Leonor's relationship (c. 1410-12) and reveals the anger the Queen later felt towards Leonor after having been the Queen's primary advisor and confidant. Communicating indirectly to Leonor through her "aposentador mayor", Pero López de Ayala, the Queen writes, if Leonor "mi criada" dares to return to Toledo: "que la prendades e le tomedes todo quanto traxiere…" (Perea Rodríguez quoting Queen Catalina of Lancaster 192). There is some speculation that it was after this fall from grace that Leonor felt inspired to write her memoir as a defense and explanation of her life.
